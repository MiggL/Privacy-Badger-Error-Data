# The influence of Privacy Badger on the occurence of Javascript errors
Using privacy extensions such as Privacy Badger may introduce Javascript errors when visiting certain websites.

This repository contains scripts for collecting and comparing Javascript errors. The scripts are based on the [DeadClick benchmark](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/bikiniproxy/tree/master/DeadClick). The purpose is to analyze how browsing with Privacy Badger affects the frequency of the most common error messages.
