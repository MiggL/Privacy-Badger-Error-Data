# The influence of Privacy Badger on the occurence of Javascript errors
Using privacy extensions such as Privacy Badger may introduce Javascript errors when visiting certain websites.

### Error Classes
The `error_classes` directory contains older scripts for collecting and comparing Javascript errors. The scripts are based on the [DeadClick benchmark](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/bikiniproxy/tree/master/DeadClick). The purpose is to analyze how browsing with Privacy Badger affects the frequency of the most common error messages.

### Repairing with BikiniProxy
The `BikiniProxy_data` directory contains scripts and data for measuring how effective [BikiniProxy](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/bikiniproxy) is at repairing errors caused by Privacy Badger.
